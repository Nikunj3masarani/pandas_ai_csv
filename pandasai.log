### QUERY
 Which are the top 5 countries by sales?

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

        effective components, immobilizing, and post-treating; the post-treatment
        step is that soybean lecithin, nano hydroxyapatite, polyethylene glycol 400
        and water are uniformly mixed to obtain spray liquid; uniformly spraying the
        spraying liquid on the surface of the solid carrier, and drying after the
        spraying is finished to obtain a biological preparation for promoting the
        growth and development of plants; the invention can simultaneously promote
        the growth and development of crops, improve the yield of the crops and the
        quality of the agricultural products, prolong the action time and have little
        influence on the action effect by soil conditions and high storage stability
        while improving the stress resistance of the crops.'




Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 How many inputs are there?

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.
